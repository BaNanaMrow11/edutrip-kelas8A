    <table border="5px">
        <p>
            Wsg gang, we're gonna be doing some IPS work.
            There are 6 questions and we're gonna go through them all.
        </p>

        <h2>Question 1: National Palace Museum</h2>
        <p>
            Okay so question 1 is asking us to choose an artifact we saw in the National Palace Museum and explain what it said about the society at its time. 
            I chose the meat rock, found in 2011 but there are stories about it from between the Qing Dynasty and Ming Dynasty.
            Folklore has it that during these times, some citizens of the dynasty were very poor and all they could eat was rice and kecap.
            However, the emperor at the time eat meat like it was nothing!! (So greedy)
            So when they found the meat rock, the poor would look at it and eat to make themselves think they were eating meat, like a placebo effect.
            One day, someone showed this rock to the emperor and said, "You're up here eating meat while your people are down there eating rocks!"
            (We got this story from our 1-day tour guide, Laoshi Willy) 
            This shows the famine and struggle the common folk had to struggle with because of their low ranking position.
            All this while the ones higher up continued to live life lavishly without trully caring for the ones lower than them, after all, they seemed insignificant to the ones with higher authority and status.
        </p>

        <h3>This is the meat rock in question. It is actually really small...</h3>

        <h2>Question 2: Interview</h2>
        <p>
            Question 2 asks us to interview a staff member at the National Palace museum to find out what traditional aspects can still be found in the modern society today.
            According to one of the staff members working near the Jade section, "Some aspects of old that can still be found in today's society are China sets (pottery, tea sets, etc), night markets, Feng Shui in architecture, etc"
            She was a bit busy at the time and so were the other staff so that's the best I got ðŸ¤·
        </p>

        <h2>Question 3: Chisingtan Scenic Area</h2>
        <p>
            Question 3 tells us to observe the Chisingtan Scenic Area and how the people around there use their environment to make a living.
            One of the main attractions of the Chisingtan Scenic Area was the rocky shore. 
            On those shores, we found pieces of beautiful green rocks (although we weren't sure what kind of rocks they were).
            On the way back to the bus, I saw a lot of old ladies selling these beautiful pieces of jewlry on little stands along the pathway.
            Each necklace and ring had a shiny and polished gem, usually a green one which made me realize.
            These ladies are using the abundant resources of gems on the shore to create products and attract tourists.
            Green gems are usually associated with emeralds or jade (which will be our focus). Jade in Chinese belief are greatly thought of as a precious gem.
            That's why you usually see a lot of older Chinese women wearing the cool gems on their necks and wrists.
            Using this information, the sellers take the green gems and polish them to turn them into sellable products.
            Although they may not be jade stones, they could be convincing enough to look like them or attract people anyway due to the shiny glimmer of the stone.
            That's how these women make money from the beach!

        <h2>Question 4: Keelong Night Market</h2>
        <p>
            Question 4 isn't really a question but a requirement. It requires us to take a photo with our respective groups in the Keelong Night Market (of which I don't have...)
            Not only did my phone die, I didn't read the IPS assignment page so I couldn't remind Audrey to take a photo ðŸ˜­
            The closest thing I have to a photo in the Keelong Night Market is this photo of me and Audrey's monster energy drinks at the meetup checkpoint (which was a mall).
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Question 5: Interview part 2</h2>
        <p>
            Question 5 is another interview session where we have to interview a domestic tourist or guide about the traditions still available in "the location". 
            I'm going to assume "the location" is the Keelong market. My teacher/tour guide told me that in the Keelong Night Market they still use traditional food tents due to practicality and tradition.
            That's all I got because I was hungry and had to eat...
        </p>

        <h2>Question 6: Okay what on earth is this??</h2>
        <p>
            Wow, Pak Oky sure loves his interviews because this one requires us to do 5 QUESTIONS WORTH OF INTERVIEWS. IN DIFFERENT PLACES.
            Of which I didn't do :33 BUT the question also said we had to do observations which I unconciously did throughout the trip.
            Let's do this (This is the final question I HAVE to finish this PLEASE give me strength)
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This subquestion is asking us about the conditions of most of the buildings.
                    I went to a few different cities so we're going to have to seperate this again!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taoyuan: The buildings in Taoyuan were relatively tall but not that modern. 
                    It felt a lot like older buildings that are slowly deteriorating with time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hualien: A lot of the buildings in Hualien were low buildings and if they were tall, it would usually be one shop on top of another shop.
                    It felt a lot more cozy/home-y because of the low buildings and shops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taipei: For Taipei, it depends on where in Taipei you are.
                    It's kinda like Jakarta, some alleyways have shorter buildings that are dirty-looking while some areas have luxurious high rise buildings.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This subquestion asks us about how the society cares for the past.
                    I can tell that they quite care about their traditions and upholding them, I make this statement because of the frequesnt night markets and the whole Chiang Kai Shek memorial hall.
                    They care for the past by upholding traditions while growing forward too. They aren't stuck in the past but they intergrate it into their modern lives.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This subquestion asks us about the urban planning for tourist destinations.
                    Taiwanâ€™s urban planning focuses on high-density development, efficient public transport (like MRT and HSR), and mixed-use spaces. 
                    Cities balance modern skyscrapers with traditional markets and temples. 
                    Green spaces, smart city tech, and disaster resilience (earthquake/flood planning) are also key priorities.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                This subquestion asks about how the different generations communicate and interact with each other.
                In Taiwan, interactions among generations are strong, with respect for elders being important. 
                Younger people care for and support older family members, while elders pass down traditions and values. 
                Families often live together or stay closely connected, and festivals/reunions strengthen these bonds.
            </li>
            <li>
                This last subquestion asks about the public belief or trust in Taiwan.
                Taiwanese society values trust in family, education, and community. 
                People generally trust the government, especially in healthcare and disaster response. 
                However, skepticism exists toward political parties and media. 
                Traditional beliefs, like fortune-telling and Feng Shui, still influence daily life.
            </li>
        </ol>
