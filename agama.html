        <h2>What's up gang</h2>
        <p>
            So for religion class (Catholicism) we had to answer a few questions regarding our destinations.
            The first destination we were asked about in our workbook was the Holy Family Catholic Church in Taipei.
            It asked us about the differences we saw when comparing the Holy Family Church to whichever church we usually go to, the history behind the HFCC, and what made the church so interesting. 
            We had morning mass there on the second day (the day after arrival) and I prayed to the Mother Mary Statue they had. I also lit a candle and donated some money.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3>This is the Holy Family Catholic Church's exterior!!</h3>

        <h2>Destination 1, question 1: Differences</h2>
        <p>
            As I said before, the first question was about the differences between the Holy Family Catholic Church and whichever church we usually went to.
            I chose the Santo Laurensius Church in Alam Sutera because its the church I am most familiar with. 
            I found that the setup felt a lot more spacious and empty than in Santo Laurensius and the altar boys and sacristy girls didn't sit down after their part during the mass. 
            I also figured out that they used a projector to display the text for the songs played instead of a monitor like in my church. I later found out the app they used for the text was PowerPoint.
            The Father who was leading the mass that day used a more relatable example to prove his point. This might just be because I understood his speech better due to this being an English mass.
            Those were the differences I saw when comparing the Holy Family Catholic Church and the Santo Laurensius Church. 
        </p>

        <h2>Destination 1, question 2: History</h2>
        <p>
            The Holy Family Catholic Church has a pretty interesting history. 
            It was originally built in the mid-20th century as a place of worship for the growing Catholic community in Taiwan, especially as more missionaries and foreign residents arrived.
            Over time, it became a well-known church in Taipei, not just for its religious services but also for its strong community involvement. 
            The church has hosted countless weddings, baptisms, and gatherings, bringing together people from different backgrounds.
            One of the coolest things about it is its architecture‚Äîblending Western and Eastern styles, which kind of represents how Christianity found a place in Taiwanese culture. 
            It's not just a religious site; it‚Äôs also a symbol of cultural exchange. 
            Today, it remains an active church, welcoming both locals and visitors looking for a place of peace, prayer, or just a bit of quiet in the middle of Taipei‚Äôs busy streets.

    <h2>Destination 1, question 3: Mystique</h2>
    <p>
        What made the Holy Family Church so interesting to me was its odd architecture. 
        The church was shaped like a T with the middle section being placed in front of the alter, the left side being used for more seats and the choir, and the right side being used for more seats.
        Hualien was seated on the right side with Keelong behind us and Kaoshiung being seated in the middle section.

    <h3>My lackluster rendition of the interior setup of the HFCC üòùüòù</h3>
    <p>
        Another thing that became the highlight of this church were the windows, specifically the tinted glass windows in the church.
        They were gorgeous, I couldn't take my eyes off of them. (That doesn't mean I didn't pay attention to the mass itself!)
        The rainbow gradient of reds, yellows, greens, and blues was a beautiful way of letting sunlight in, opposed to artificial lighting.
        The glass panes were especially pretty when I took off my glasses, the colours all blended together seemlessly!

        Next up is our 2nd destination, the Tzu Chi Foundation Resource Centre! 
        The workbook asked about the importance, impact and history of the Tzu Chi Foundation Resource Centre. 
        Let's get into it!!!
    </p>

    <h2>Destination 2, question 1: Importance</h2>
    <p>
        The Tzu Chi Foundation Resource Centre in Hualien is super important because it's the heart of the Tzu Chi Foundation, a massive Buddhist humanitarian organization that focuses on charity, medical aid, disaster relief, and environmental protection.
        Since Hualien is where Tzu Chi was founded in 1966 by Dharma Master Cheng Yen, the Resource Centre serves as both a headquarters and a place where volunteers and visitors can learn about their work. 
        It houses historical exhibits, showcases Tzu Chi's impact around the world, and even has interactive areas where people can see how donations and recycling efforts are used to help communities in need.
        On top of that, it‚Äôs an educational hub that teaches visitors about compassion, sustainability, and volunteerism, making it a key part of Hualien‚Äôs culture and social outreach. 
        Whether it's helping disaster victims, running hospitals, or promoting eco-friendly practices, the work done here has a global reach.

    <h2>Destination 2, question 3: History</h2>
    <p>
        The Tzu Chi Foundation was founded in 1966 in Hualien, Taiwan, by Dharma Master Cheng Yen, a Buddhist nun who wanted to help those in need. 
        It all started with a small group of housewives who saved a few coins each day in bamboo tubes to provide aid to the poor. 
        Over time, this effort grew into a large humanitarian organization. In 1986, Tzu Chi established Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Taiwan‚Äôs first Buddhist hospital, to offer high-quality medical care, especially to underserved communities. 
        This was followed by the founding of Tzu Chi University and other schools to train compassionate medical professionals and promote education.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tzu Chi expanded its work beyond Taiwan, providing disaster relief, medical aid, and environmental programs around the world. 
        The foundation became known for its global humanitarian efforts, helping victims of natural disasters, war, and poverty. 
        Today, Hualien remains the heart of Tzu Chi, home to its medical center, university, and headquarters. 
        It stands as a symbol of the foundation‚Äôs mission: to bring compassion, relief, and hope to people everywhere.

        <p>
            Our final destination was the Tzu Chi Foundation Resource Centre but this time, we were sorting trash!!! 
            It was very fun, I took apart bicycle wheels :33 We were asked about what we did, what the importance of doing community work was and how it related to being a child/student of Jesus. 
            Let's answer em!!!!! (I'm so tired at this point)
        </p>

        <h2>Destination 3, question 1: Activity</h2>
        <p>
            So at first, our tour guide introduced us to the history of Tzu Chi as a whole as well as their motives.
            He told us again about the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) but told us to think of more like Refuse, Rethink, etc. 
            After the whole introduction part, he showed us around the stations where different types of trash were seperated and sorted.
            Then we were seperated into groups and my group got to see a baby's bicycle get partially torn apart. Then we got seperated into sub-groups!!
            My sub-group consisted of me, Michael, and Clara. We got to deconstruct several bicycle wheels by cutting the wires and taking apart the metal-alluminium parts.
            According to our supervisor, Darren, the metal-alluminium parts were the most expensive. 
            Oh yeah, the main reason why they had to take apart bicycle wheels was to sell the individual parts, whether to be melted or reused somehow.
            Then we got to check out their thrift store, I would've bought something but I forgot my wallet... We tried their snacks and learned a bit more about the place before leaving. 
        </p>

        <h2>Destination 3, question 2: Importance</h2>
        <p>
            I saw a lot of old people working there, if not all of them. Even our tour guide that day was an old man (no offence).
            They were all grannies and grandpas who were devoted to working for the environment and for the cause of Tzu Chi.
            So I feel like doing community service not only helps us develop skills we might (or might not) need for the future, but takes the weight of a workload off of someone else's back.
            Seperating trash and taking apart minor machinery can greatly help with our motor skills and ability to coordinate between our hands and eyes quickly.
            Working with the elderly (especially in a foreign language) can help with our cooperation and social skills while also teaching us compassion as we work alongside older people with many stories to tell. 
            I heard from our teacher that many students were complaining about it being hot, there being a lot of bugs, and so on so forth. Many were asking, "When are we going to be done?"
            Based on that observation, this experience also taught us about perseverence and not being so soft when it comes to hard labor.
            Those are the many things (aside from the obvious lesson, be mindful of your trash) that we could take away from community service.
        </p>

        <h2>Destination 3, question 3: Corelation</h2>
        <p>
            Due to this being religion class, we are of course asked questions about how any of this relates to being a child/student of Jesus.
            My answer to that is that not only are we "respecting thy neighbor" but we are also learning to carry the burden of our own like Jesus did with our sins.
            "How are we respecting thy neighbor?" I hear you ask. Well, the Tzu Chi Foundation is a Buddhist foundation but they accept all religions and races to join them.
            These people are connected by their focus to help others through the Tzu Chi Foundation and they must work together to achive that.
            We had to put aside our religion difference and work with those of different ages and religion with respect. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As for "carrying our own burden", we as humans have a lot of trash and us as students in a more privalliged setting don't usually sort that trash out.
            But due to this act of community service, we got to feel the weight of our trash in the form of labor.
            Yes, it may have not been OUR trash but we as children of God cannot be individuallistic. It is the trash of our siblings in Christ so we shall help them clean it up.
            Like Jesus did, he was the one who dies on the cross for OUR sins, not his own. So we as his children must do the same and set a good example for our younger siblings in Christ.
        </p>
        <h2>Bye-bye</h2>
        <p>
            So that's it for the religion page, Godbless üôèüôè
