        <h2>Welcome to the gallery of me absolutely winging this</h2>
        <p>
            Okay, I'm going to be so for real right now, we did not have an assignment for PPKn class. At least in my memory. 
            All I remember were some questions that were obviously religion-related, an English assignment, a BINDO assignment, a Mandarin assignment and this assignment that you're looking at right now. 
            I physically cannot remember ANYTHING related to PPKn whatsoever. If there was, I probably mistook it for an IPS assignment. ðŸ˜“
            <!--If there actually a PPKn assignment for edutrip i will delete and redo this passage, if not im keeping it for the funnys-->
        </p>

        <p>
            UPDATE (from like 40 minutes later), there is none. 
            None of my classmates remember having one and I sure don't either !!! 
            So I'll just be talking about the cultural aspects we saw in Taiwan because that's what we're learning in PPKn.
            (Y'know, besides the whole democracy thing of which I have no idea how to apply to this situation)
            So in this page I wanna talk about Chiang Kai Shek, and the traditions + cultures I observed in Taiwan.

        <h2>Chiang Kai Shek</h2>
        <p>
            I know that this is more related to IPS than it is to PPKn but I will be talking about the history of Chiang Kai Shek and how his leadership shaped the people of Taiwan.
            (That is very related to PPKn ðŸ˜Ž)
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Chiang Kai-shek was a Chinese political and military leader who played a key role in 20th-century China. 
            Born in 1887, he became the leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) after the death of Sun Yat-sen and led China through both the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. 
            Initially, he fought to unify China under the Nationalist government, but after losing to Mao Zedongâ€™s Communist forces in 1949, he and his followers retreated to Taiwan, where he established a separate government.
            As the leader of Taiwan (Republic of China) from 1949 until his death in 1975, Chiang ruled with an iron fist, enforcing martial law but also overseeing Taiwanâ€™s economic growth and modernization. 
            His legacy is controversial; some see him as a defender against communism, while others criticize his authoritarian rule. 
            Today, places like the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei reflect both his historical impact and the ongoing debate about his leadership.

        <h3>The Impact of Chiang Kai Shek's Leadership</h3>
        <p>
            Chiang Kai-shek's leadership had a significant and lasting impact on the culture of Taiwan, shaping its political, social, and cultural landscapes. 
            His regime, which began when the Kuomintang (KMT) retreated to Taiwan in 1949 following the Chinese Civil War, was marked by a strict, authoritarian government. 
            Under his rule, Taiwan adopted a one-party system with the KMT having total control over the government. 
            This created a culture of political repression, where dissent and opposition were harshly suppressed. 
            The KMTâ€™s rule also fostered a sense of loyalty to the party and its ideals, influencing Taiwanâ€™s political culture for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key elements of Chiangâ€™s leadership was the promotion of Chinese nationalism. 
            Chiangâ€™s government strongly emphasized the idea that the Republic of China (ROC) was the legitimate government of all of China, even though they only controlled Taiwan and a few small islands. 
            This notion created a culture of "China-centered" identity, with many Taiwanese citizens identifying with the ROC and its mission to retake mainland China. 
            However, this sentiment evolved over time, contributing to the development of a distinct Taiwanese identity that increasingly diverged from mainland China.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under Chiangâ€™s rule, there was also a concerted effort to suppress local Taiwanese identity. 
            The government promoted "one China" policies and sought to instill a unified national culture based on mainland Chinese traditions. 
            As part of this, Mandarin was made the official language, while local languages such as Hokkien and Hakka were marginalized. 
            Cultural practices that were tied to Taiwanese identity were also suppressed, as the government worked to ensure cultural expression was aligned with KMT ideals and central government control.
        </p>
        <p>
            The KMT also heavily invested in education, using it as a tool for political indoctrination. 
            Schools taught a history that emphasized Chinese nationalism and the KMTâ€™s role in resisting communism, sidelining Taiwan's unique history and culture. 
            This education system aimed to create a unified national identity and loyalty to the ROC, but it also reinforced a narrative that overlooked Taiwanâ€™s distinct cultural and historical experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Chiangâ€™s political leadership was largely authoritarian, his government also laid the groundwork for Taiwanâ€™s rapid economic development in the 1960s and 1970s. 
            The focus on industrialization and modernization helped to transform Taiwan into one of the "Four Asian Tigers," contributing to a significant rise in living standards and the growth of a middle class. 
            This economic growth influenced Taiwanese society, driving urbanization and social changes that integrated Taiwan more into the global economy and altered its cultural dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Chiangâ€™s leadership was also marked by periods of political repression, notably during the era of martial law (1949â€“1987) and the White Terror. 
            During this time, thousands of Taiwanese were arrested, tortured, or executed for suspected disloyalty or communist sympathies. 
            This period of fear and censorship deeply affected Taiwanâ€™s cultural landscape, suppressing free expression and creating a climate of silence. 
            Yet, it also fostered a culture of resistance among some intellectuals and artists, who used subtle forms of dissent to critique the government.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legacy of Chiang Kai-shek remains a subject of debate in Taiwan today. 
            While he is credited with Taiwanâ€™s economic success and modernization, his authoritarian rule and repression of Taiwanese culture have left a mixed legacy. 
            In recent years, there has been a growing movement to reevaluate and distance Taiwanâ€™s identity from Chiangâ€™s influence. 
            Younger generations increasingly identify with a distinct Taiwanese national identity, separate from the Chinese nationalism promoted by Chiang. 
            This shift has led to the removal of Chiang's statues and a reassessment of his role in Taiwanâ€™s history.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, Chiang Kai-shekâ€™s leadership had a profound and multifaceted impact on Taiwanâ€™s culture. 
            His regime fostered economic development but also imposed political repression and cultural suppression in the name of Chinese nationalism. 
            Today, his legacy continues to shape the political and cultural identity of Taiwan, with ongoing debates about how to view his rule in the context of Taiwan's evolving sense of self.

        <h2>My Observation on the Taiwanese People</h2>
        <p>
            I saw that a lot of the Taiwanese people are quiet and usually mind their own business.
            This might be because of the aforementioned suppression caused by the rule of Chiang Kai Shek that has been implemented in the culture of Taiwan but idk.
            The only a few people asked us about your destination and why we were all wearing the same uniform (our jackets) and they were all older people. 
            The younger folks didn't really say much, they usually just looked at us or worked with us if need be.
            This isn't to say that the Taiwanese people are rude or individuallistic, it's just an observation of mine that they are very quiet.
            Another thing I saw is that they work quickly and efficiently. This is probably because they are a more developed country technologically and in terms of advancements.
