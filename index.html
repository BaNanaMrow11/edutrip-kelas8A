           So basically Santa Laurensia School (MY school) went on an Educational Trip!!!
            I chose to go to Taiwan and we did some fun stuff but it is an educational trip so like, we have work now :(
        </p>

        <h2>What we did!!!</h2>
        <p>So we went there by plane for like 5 hours and we met our tour guide/teacher on the bus!!
            We settled in the hotel for a night and I'm going to be honest, I didn't sleep that night. 
            Then the next day we went to the Holy Family Catholic Church. We took notes about the church and stuff then we moved to Yilan and plucked onions. 
            It was there when my phone broke because I was washing the spring onions and I was wearing my phone on a necklace-like hook and it dipped into the onion water. 
            After that we settled into our new hotel in Hualien !!! I didn't sleep that night either (I think). 
            Then we spent the next 3 days in the Stella Maris Ursuline Highschool, getting to know the students and stuff. 
            On the first of those 3 days, we visited the school and then the Tzu Chi Foundation Resource Centre and learned a ton about its history. Then for dinner, we went to the DongDaMen Night Market.
        </p>

                <h3>This is the Tzu Chi Foundation Resource Centre!!</h3>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                On the 2nd day (of those 3 days), we did some charity work at the Tzu Chi Foundation Resource Centre.
                Me, Michael, and Clara took apart like 10 bicycle wheels. Then after that, we went back to the school
                and spent some time with the students. After that, we went to the Amis Mochi Factory and made some mochis.
                I'm not going to lie, the mochis did not taste very good...
            </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>This is me in the mochi factory, not a very good image but I have to make do with what Audrey took cuz my phone died.</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                On the last of those 3 days, we spent one last day with the Stella Maris students by doing some fun
                experiments and cooking dumplings!!
                We then transferred to Taipei by bus and visited the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall. After that, we went to
                the XiMenDing Night Market by the Taipei MRT and walking. We checked into the hotel and I was very happy
                because all 4 buses had to share the same hotel, which meant being able to see my boyfriend!!! (He was in Kaohsiung)
                </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                The next day, Hualien visited the Yehliu Geopark. It was an absolute disaster. So when we were driving there,
                it was raining hard, but when we arrived, it was barely drizzling, so I thought my umbrella would keep me safe.
                *loud incorrect buzzer*
            </p>

            <div>

            </div>

            <p>
                Everything was okay at first but then the rain got harder and harder until it was basically Noah's Arc.
                Seriously, the wind and rain got so strong I felt like my fatahh was going to fly away. 
                Me, Michael, Audrey, and Danish attempted to walk across the bridge but after less than 15 minutes of trying to get anywhere, we gave up and went back.
                My umbrella flipped inside out because of the wind and part of it broke off. We all came back drenched; except Jacob because how big his raincoat was. 
                We had lunch in a nearby seafood restaurant (the food lowkey sucked) and then we headed to the Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant and learned about how nuclear energy works.
                Then we went to the Shifen old street and lit a lantern full of our written wishes! Then we went to the Jiufen old street, climbed a ton of stairs, and bought souvenirs despite being told not to. 
                For dinner that night, we went to the Keelong Night Market. Also yes, this was all in one day... So tiring.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the second to last day, we visited the National Palace Museum and Hualien swapped tour guides with Kaohsiung. 
                We looked at a ton of different ancient artifacts from China and learned about their histories and meaning towards the royals in China. 
                After that, we went to the Pineapple Cake Factory and made traditional Taiwanese pineapple cakes. We were then forced to buy from their shop which costed me 500 NDT. 
                Then we went to the Taipei 101 observatory and looked around the city!! It was so cool, then we gambled at the gacha machine and bought REALLY EXPENSIVE souvenirs.
                </p>

                    <h3>This is the view from the observatory!! Michael took the photo.</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                Then we looked around the Taiyi area and went back to the hotel for the Gala dinner with all 4 busses (fyi Keelong had 2 busses).
                The Gala dinner was actually quite nice because I got to sit with my boyfriend. In the middle of the dinner, everyone who had their birthday in March was called up to the stage and asked a set of questions.
                "What's your name? What are your hopes for the future? Do you have a girlfriend/boyfriend?" One of the people called was my boyfriend (no name dropping).
                So one by one, each person answer the questions and the most common answer for the last one was "no". That was up until my boyfriend said yes. 
                The crowd went wild and he was asked who was the lucky girl and I raised my hand. (Lowkey kinda a mistake but whatever, it was fun)
                I was called onto the stage and the MC teased us and cut the mega cake. That night was quite fun but I still get teased about it until now. 
            </p>

            <p>
                On the last day, we went to the airport and flew back home to Indonesia. The flight took around 4.5 hours and I watched the Blue Period Live Action Movie.
                I also listened to Superache by Conan Gray and fell asleep.     
            </p>
